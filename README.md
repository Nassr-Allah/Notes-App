# Notes-App
This Android app allows users to create, edit, view, and delete notes. The app is built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and includes a Room database to store the notes. The app also uses MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture to manage state and Coroutines and Flows for asynchronous operations.

# Features

The app includes the following features:

- Add notes: Users can create new notes by entering a title and body text.

- Edit notes: Users can edit the title and body text of existing notes.

- View notes: Users can view a list of all their notes, with the title and first few lines of the body text displayed.

- Delete notes: Users can delete any notes they no longer need.

# Technologies Used

- Kotlin: A modern programming language used for developing Android apps.

- Jetpack Compose: A modern toolkit for building native Android UIs with declarative Kotlin code.

- Room Database: A database library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while using less boilerplate code.

- MVI Architecture: A design pattern used for building Android apps that separates the business logic and presentation layers.

- Coroutines: A library for writing asynchronous code that is more concise and easier to read than traditional callbacks or threads.

- Flows: A reactive stream library that allows developers to write asynchronous, non-blocking code that can react to changes in data.
